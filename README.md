# K9Quick

The basic idea behind K9QUICK is to provide K-9 handlers with a fast, flexible way to record as much or as little information as they need about training and deployment activities. This program is designed to streamline the record-keeping process while maintaining simplicity and accessibility.

Portable and Easy to Use

K9QUICK is highly portable. It can run directly from a folder on a Windows computer or even from a thumb drive. This portability means handlers and trainers can update their records wherever they are, whether in the office, at a training site, or in the field. There’s no need to rely on a specific device, ensuring the program is always ready when you need it.

Universal File Format

The program saves all data in a .CSV file (comma-separated values), a widely used format compatible with Excel and many other spreadsheet programs. This universal file format ensures long-term accessibility to your records, even if you stop using K9QUICK in the future. Additionally, the .CSV format allows for seamless sharing—handlers and trainers can easily email the small, lightweight file back and forth when updates are made.

Simple and Reliable Backup Options

Backing up your records with K9QUICK is straightforward and doesn’t require complicated cloud services or expensive server connections. If you can send an email, you can back up your records. Just email the .CSV file to yourself, your supervisor, or another secure location. In case your computer or thumb drive is lost or damaged, you can retrieve the file from your email or other storage location and pick up right where you left off.

Low System Requirements

Since K9QUICK doesn’t require installation, it can run on most Windows computers with basic user permissions. This eliminates the need for administrative rights in many cases. For more restricted systems, minor adjustments or permissions may be required, but these are easy to obtain from a network administrator.

Conclusion

K9QUICK is designed to be a practical, efficient tool for K-9 handlers and trainers. Its portability, compatibility, and ease of use make it a reliable solution for maintaining accurate training and deployment records, no matter where the job takes you. Whether you’re working on a remote training site or managing records in the office, K9QUICK simplifies the process while keeping your data secure and easily accessible.
